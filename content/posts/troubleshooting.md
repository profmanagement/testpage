The error message you're encountering indicates that your local repository is out of sync with the remote repository on GitHub. This typically happens when the remote repository has commits that your local repository doesn't have. To resolve this, you'll need to update your local repository with the changes from the remote repository before pushing your new changes.

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Fetch and Rebase Remote Changes**

   This step updates your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository and replays your local commits on top of them:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```


   -If your default branch is named `master` instead of `main`, replace `main` with `master` in the command above

   -If you encounter merge conflicts during this process, Git will pause and allow you to resolve them. After resolving any conflicts, continue the rebase with

     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

2. **Push Your Changes to the Remote Repository**

   After successfully rebasing, you can push your local commits to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```


   -Again, replace `main` with `master` if that's your default branch name

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Avoid Using `--force`**:While you might come across suggestions to use `git push --force`, this command can overwrite changes in the remote repository, potentially leading to data loss. It's safer to use `git pull --rebase` as described above

- **Regularly Sync with Remote**:To minimize such conflicts, regularly pull changes from the remote repository before making new commits
